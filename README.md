# Congressional Bill Tracker

## Making Congress Accessible to Everyone

The Congressional Bill Tracker is a modern, user-friendly platform designed to help everyday Americans understand and track what's happening in Congress. We believe that understanding legislative activities shouldn't require a law degree or hours of research.

## Why This Matters

In today's complex political landscape, it's more important than ever to stay informed about the laws and policies that affect our daily lives. However, congressional bills are often written in complex legal language that can be difficult for most people to understand. Our platform bridges this gap by:

- **Simplifying Complex Bills**: We use AI to generate clear, concise summaries of bills in plain English
- **Real-Time Updates**: Track bills as they move through Congress, from introduction to becoming law
- **Easy Navigation**: Find bills by topic, status, or keyword without getting lost in legal jargon
- **Visual Progress**: See exactly where each bill is in the legislative process
- **Comprehensive Information**: Access sponsor details, voting records, and related bills all in one place
