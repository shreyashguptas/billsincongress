# Architecture

## Overview

The Congressional Bill Tracker follows a modern React architecture using Next.js 13's App Router. The application is built with a component-based architecture, emphasizing reusability and maintainability.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Next.js App Router
- Utilizes the new App Router for improved routing and layouts
- Server Components for better performance
- Client Components when interactivity is needed

### 2. Component Structure
```
components/
├── ui/          # Base UI components
├── bills/       # Bill-specific components
├── layout/      # Layout components
└── shared/      # Shared components
```

### 3. Data Flow
- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Props for component communication
- Types for data structure definition

### 4. State Management
- React's built-in useState for local state
- Server Components for remote data
- Future consideration for global state management

## File Organization

### App Directory Structure
```
app/
├── bills/
│   ├── [id]/     # Individual bill pages
│   └── page.tsx  # Bills listing page
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx
├── layout.tsx
└── page.tsx
```

### Component Organization
- Components are grouped by feature
- Shared components in ui directory
- Feature-specific components in dedicated directories

## Performance Considerations

1. Server Components
   - Used for static content
   - Reduces client-side JavaScript

2. Client Components
   - Used only when needed
   - Marked with 'use client' directive

3. Image Optimization
   - Next.js Image component
   - Responsive images
   - Lazy loading
