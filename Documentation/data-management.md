# Data Management

## Database Schema

### Core Tables Overview

The database is structured around a central `bill_info` table with several related tables containing specific aspects of bills. All related tables use the bill's ID as a foreign key, creating a hub-and-spoke model where `bill_info` is the hub.

### Common Features Across Tables

1. **Timestamps**
   - All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
   - Auto-managed by triggers for tracking record history

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - All tables have RLS enabled
   - Read access for authenticated users
   - Write access restricted to service role

3. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Primary key columns are automatically indexed
   - Foreign key columns have dedicated indexes
   - Additional indexes on frequently queried columns

4. **Cascade Deletion**
   - All child tables have ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Deleting from bill_info cascades to all related records

### Data Integrity

1. **Primary Keys**
   - `bill_info`: Single column (id)
   - Other tables: Composite keys including id
   - Ensures unique identification of records

2. **Foreign Keys**
   - All tables reference bill_info(id)
   - Enforces referential integrity
   - Prevents orphaned records

3. **NOT NULL Constraints**
   - Applied to essential columns
   - Ensures data completeness
   - Maintains data quality

### Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**
   - Strategic indexing for common queries
   - Foreign key indexes for joins
   - Composite indexes where needed

2. **Denormalization**
   - Some redundant data for performance
   - Balanced with data integrity needs
   - Optimized for read operations

### Security Model

1. **Row Level Security**
   - Read: Authenticated users
   - Write: Service role only
   - Policies defined per table

2. **Service Role Access**
   - Used for data synchronization
   - Bypasses RLS for maintenance
   - Controlled access pattern
